## Juggling

I've been exploring the patterns that can arise from simple systems. Check out how tiny variations in the angles of these platforms can lead to all sorts of different periodic motion:

	</div>

		<div>
			<div>period 4</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>

		<div>
			<div>period 5</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>

		<div>
			<div>period 7</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<img src="resources/images/blog/11-period13.gif" />
		<div>
			<div>period 13</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

Individual examples are great and all, but I wanted to see the underlying structure, so I ran 260K simulations to get this graph:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-0.png" style="width: 66%;" />

Structure spotted! We can see areas of predictable behavior: the period-4 strip up the middle and the vertical period-2 band near the right edge. We can also see chaotic regions where the smallest change in starting conditions can completely change the results. I bet some of the discontinuities are from simulation error in Unity — I should take another swing with a heavier duty physics engine. The way I spawn new balls probably causes trouble in certain cases too.

<p style="text-indent: 0">After examining the results, I have three conjectures:</p>

* The ideal version of the above diagram is a fractal, like the ones from other physics setups:
    * [double pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7JK4Ht8k8M)
	* [pendulum and magnets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Jkgvw-Z6E)
* Initial conditions exist for all positive integer periods.
* Initial conditions exist for aperiodic motion, i.e. motion that never repeats.

Lots of further exploration that could be done here: changing the material parameters, the spawn rate and position, the sizes of the balls and platforms. There are single-platform setups that produce similar results, but I wanted two variables that made sense to graph against each other.

## Dice

In search of more patterns, I turned to an old favorite: [non-transitive dice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzKGnuvX6IQ). In short, just by rearranging the pips on a normal die in different ways, it's possible to create [complex rock-paper-scissors-like situations](http://singingbanana.com/dice/article.htm) where there's no "best" die. Maybe by battling every possible die against the other, we can make another would-be fractal! There are 110 ways to arrange the standard 21 pips on a 6-faced die such that each face has at least one pip. Let's have a look:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-21n6k1min-lex.png" style="width: 66%;" />

Green indicates a winning record of Y-axis against the X, and red is a losing record. Definitely some *fractalian* qualities, but why is it so blocky? Zooming in, we can see why:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-1.png" />

Finding all the ways to divide pips among the faces of a die is analagous to finding the [partitions of an integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) into a fixed number of parts, and most ways of doing that end up with the partitions in lexicographical order. (In this case, reverse lexicographical order, with descending partitions.) It's a logical order — the dictionary uses it for a reason — but we also know from the dictionary that things can go from *azure* to *babble* real quick, even though they're quite far apart to look at them. In the image above, there are some big jumps from die to die, and the magnitude of the difference seems to correspond with the magnitude of the discontinuity.

How do we get rid of those blocks and get a nice, smooth fractal? Ideally, we'd want to move one pip at a time, getting through all the possible dice exactly once. The absolute best case would have us starting at the least balanced die <span style="white-space: nowrap">(1-1-1-1-1-16)</span> and end at the most balanced die <span style="white-space: nowrap">(3-3-3-4-4-4).</span> Let's look at a small example of distributing 9 pips among 4 faces:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-2.png" style="width: 66%;" />

Pairs of dice are connected by an edge if they are "adjacent": if one can be turned into the other by moving a single pip. Can we get from the least balanced die to the most balanced, hitting each possibility only once?

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-3.png" style="width: 66%;" />

Sure! (There's actually more than one way, more on that later.) We've found a [Hamiltonian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) between our two nodes. That's wasn't so hard; let's a more complicated case, say distributing 14 pips across the faces of an exotic 7-sided die:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-4.png" />

Uh oh. We can find our path on this graph, sure, but we might have trouble getting all the way up to 21 pips on 6 faces — we already know that graph is going to have 110 nodes. In fact, the problem of finding Hamiltonian paths on a graph isn't just hard, it's [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness)! Gah! Who can save us?

Enter [Dr. Carla Savage](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/savage/), in 1989. The very year of my birth! In her paper [Gray code sequences of partitions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0196677489900072), she gives us exactly what we need: an algorithm to enumerate integer partitions in minimal-change order, with a very reasonable runtime. We don't even need to mess around with any of that graph nonsense. Let's just read that paper, code up an implementation, and 20 hours of eye-searing *computer science* later:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-21n6k1min-gray.png" style="width: 66%;" />

Huh. It's cool, but still a little blocky. Turns out that it's kinda hard to escape that in the land of small numbers, 21 pips on 6 faces and whatnot. But hey, fractals are all about limits, right? We must go deeper. Let's introduce some notation for the Gray-code order of *n* pips across *k* faces, *D(n, k)*, and check out D(n, 6) as n increases.

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-5.png" />

It's like a [fractal zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b005iHf8Z3g) in reverse! There seems to be some self-similarity, and if you zoom in, there are some neat details to investigate:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-6.png" style="width: 66%;" />

Varying our parameters gets us some fun patterns as well:

<img src="resources/images/blog/11-7.png" />

So do these images indicate some deep truths about how dice work? Probably not. Like I was hinting at before, as *n* and *k* increase, the number of Hamiltonian paths goes way up. For *D(12, 6)* it's 1, for *D(14, 7)* it's 52, then 652, then 298,896, then my computer doesn't want to talk about it anymore. These images are more representations of the algorithm we used to get our particular smooth ordering. Still interesting, to me at least.

Speaking of the algorithm, [here it is](https://gist.github.com/thquinn/97f3ed433a6fe5796dbbd054de851b84). A [2005 paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196677404000197) claimed that it took "twenty-five pages of C code" to implement; I think I did a little better than that. Anyway, zoom around on this big image of *D(66, 6)* down here. Goodbye!
