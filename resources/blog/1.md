# Ludum Dare 44 Postmortem
##### June 4, 2019

A week ago, I had just begun [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/), the some-number-of-times-annual event that tasks its participants with making a game in 48 hours. The theme was "your life is currency," and I made [**MeltUP**](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/meltup), a platformer where you climb a radioactive nuclear cooling tower, gradually losing abilities as your genes fray. Only by collecting uranium (exposing yourself to even more radiation) can you buy replacement genes that enable you to double jump, glide, teleport, and more.

This was my fourth time through the wringer, and it was a continuation of my own paradoxical trends. I learn tons of valuable lessons and prototyping tricks each time, but end up with a less cohesive game. I'm more comfortable with my tools, but spend more of the weekend in a sleepless crunch. I feel more confident at the outset, but I'm never as proud of the result as I was last time. And I think I've finally figured out why. I bet you can figure it out too, if I go in order and describe what players are expected to do in each game:

* **LD41:** Type each displayed word in time with the music.
* **LD42:** Select pairs of books and come up with a combined anagram for their two titles.
* **LD43:** Manage a collection of possessions and choose which to sacrifice at various points in a nonlinear story.
* **LD44:** Ascend a procedurally generated tower as fast as possible, determining when to collect resources and how to spend them on over a dozen powerups.

At this point, it's pretty clear to me that my jam games are trending upwards in complexity. I'm a sucker for complexity in games, and while I prefer the kind that [emerges naturally from simple rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), realistically I'll take [any kind I can get](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/). Turns out that that's not a good game-jam strategy, for a few reasons.

### It's a pain to implement

I've been allowing myself to engage in this kind of "and, and, and" brainstorming that tries to solve the lack of a good idea with more ideas. I understand why! I have great empathy for my week-ago self, 90 minutes into the jam with nothing to show but bullet points in a text document, but from now on I'll be pushing myself to find something more elegant. It might take more time. I hope it'll be worth it. A small, beautiful idea can be implemented in a handful of hours, while a game trying to go in a half-dozen directions is going to lose me a lot of sleep.

### It obscures the central idea

With **MeltUP**, I failed to understand how best to showcase my creativity. I often do this kind of thing when designing games. I came up with a twist to base my game around — in this case, the main resource of the game hurting the player over time, forcing them to make decisions about when and how far to go out of their way to collect it — and then I get right to overadorning it with all sorts of different powerups and abilities. A better version of the game would have put more emphasis on the central idea; anyone can think of "double jump," "glide," and "teleport," but no one is going to appreciate that if the game's foundation isn't rock solid.

### It makes it harder to find the fun

Speaking of no one appreciating a game, people don't seem to like **MeltUP** very much. I can't blame them. To get people to rate your game, you need to rate other people's games, about 20 of them. When you ask your average jammer to slog through 20 slapdash games, they're not going to have much patience for any of them individually. To catch their attention, your game needs to show off its best features in the first 30 seconds.

What does my game show off in that time? A wordy tutorial, floaty controls, and punishing difficulty. No one is going to appreciate my careful logic in weighting shop contents — and how genes are more likely to be randomly destroyed the longer you've had them, and how you can use extra jump power to skirt around certain tough platforming sections, and, and, and — if they can't be arsed to get past first impressions.

### Technical stuff

This is the second time I used Unity's still-in-preview [Vector Graphics package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.vectorgraphics@1.0/manual/index.html) for the entirety of my graphics. I was worried about performance, but I've only gotten one comment on it so far. I tested it on my laptop's (admittedly modern) integrated Intel graphics card and it ran fine, even with 4x antialiasing. The number of triangles and batches, as reported by Unity's little renderstats thinger, looks reasonable to this novice. It's insanely convenient to export directly from Illustrator into Unity as a mesh, with support for whatever crazy gradients and stuff I put on it. There were a couple oddities with the way SpriteRenderer handles these imported meshes, including not knowing up to flip certain SVGs across X or Y. I'd go easy on using it in production, but it's just great for quick prototyping.

This was my first time making a 2D platformer — in Unity or otherwise — and I had some physics issues. Surface Effector was no friend of mine, certainly, but my biggest problem was with Box Collider 2D. In a tile-based platformer, giving each tile its own collision means a line of colliders that are supposedly flush with each other:

but I found that giving the player its own Box Collider 2D caused its corners to "catch" on the seams between tiles. I couldn't figure out a time-efficient fix, so I did this:

Yikes. The slight slope fixes the catching issue, but means that if the player is falling with any speed and tries to sneak onto a platform on their way down, they're likely to get knocked away from it by the collision instead of landing on it as one would want from a 2D platformer. In a game where a fall can mean a lot of lost progress, this can be extremely frustrating, adding to complaints of bad controls and unfair difficulty. Players expect the collision of their character's feet to be flat! Add that to the list of things I hadn't considered about platformers before making this thing. I ended up programmatically combining colliders elsewhere in the code, so I could have just done that in this case as well, but there must be a better way, one that would work for things other than congruent box colliders. I suspect I'll have occasion to find out later.

### "Your life is currency"

Alright, enough about what I did wrong. There was a *lot* of complaining, more even than usual, about this theme. Even the person who submitted it [apologized and called for the voting system to be changed.](https://twitter.com/pEcOsGhOsT/status/1121943232399777797) I agree. Then there's the matter of its similarity to the previous Ludum Dare theme, "sacrifices must be made." It almost a subset. In fact, if you take semantic fiddling out of the equation, I would argue that it's a *strict* subset.

Looking at Ludum Dare in general, there's a certain flavor of theme that consistently makes it to the later stages of voting:

* The player is a side character
* The player is the villain
* You control the environment instead of a character
* You control the enemies instead of a character
* There's only one enemy
* You get weaker as you progress
* You only have 10/30/60 seconds

Voters seem to love this kind of "subversion" that ultimately [isn't](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/) [especially](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/) [subversive](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43). These themes are prescriptive, don't port well to all genres, and tend to not be very inspiring. The best jam themes — "beneath the surface," "chain reaction," "a small world," last year's "running out of space" — are more broadly conceptual; they bombard you with possibilities and create delightful surprises when you play other people's creations. "Wow," you say to yourself, "I didn't even think about it like that." No such moments with *your life is currency.* "Yep," you say to yourself, "the life in this game sure is currency."

That's not to say there were no clever takes on the theme this time around. And that's not to say that conceptual themes can't go wrong: see the fumbling sentimentality of ["what home means to you"](https://twitter.com/globalgamejam/status/1089016923776462849) from this year's Global Game Jam. But I can't shake the feeling that most people who vote for this kind of theme (a) don't actually think about what it would mean to make a game with such a constraint, (b) don't actually stick around to make a game, and (c) are actually [14 years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisdeep/). To conclude: I think the system could use a shake up, especially since the winners are often determined less by enthusiasm from talented people and more by [whichever idea people hate the least](https://twitter.com/mikekasprzak/status/1121944635486687232).

Such negativity! Expect further incautious pessimism as this fledgling blog progresses.

### To conclude, again

I had some real good fun during this Ludum Dare, and I can't wait to do it again in October. I had resolved this time to make a real game — not a typing game, not a word game, not a story game, but a *game* game. A gamer's game. And I did, to little acclaim. Maybe I'll go back to using language as a crutch for my next one, but either way, I'm aiming for purity. Restraint. Polish. And a certain *je ne sais quoi.* Come back in six months to see if I succeeded.
