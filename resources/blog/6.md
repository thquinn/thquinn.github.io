# Monte Carlo & Magic the Gathering
##### December 7, 2020

<img src="resources/images/blog/6-0.jpg" style="width: 33%;" />

While nothing beats Booster Draft, my first love in Magic was the terrible kitchen-table combo. I'm talking <auto-card>Isochron Scepter</auto-card> and <auto-card>Silence</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fatestitcher</auto-card> and <auto-card>Pemmin's Aura</auto-card>, that kind of thing. [Magic Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) doesn't have a large enough card pool for brewing, and I'd always been hesitant to buy into an older format like Modern on the creaky [Magic the Gathering Online](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo)... so imagine my excitement to discover [Penny Dreadful](https://pennydreadfulmagic.com/), a format where only cards worth 2 cents or less are legal! You can use free loans from MTGO trade bots to play any deck in the format without parting with a cent. If you've already paid for an MTGO account, that is. Anyway, this post isn't really about Penny Dreadful. (Try it, though.)

I didn't know how to code back in the Mirrodin era, but I do now, so why not write a little something to optimize a combo decklist? I'd seen Jan van der Vegt [try to apply machine learning](https://github.com/janvdvegt/belchAIr) to <auto-card>Goblin Charbelcher</auto-card>, and while that's still a little beyond me, we can learn a thing or two from regular ol' Monte Carlo. I found a combo that met my needs (simple, janky, unpopular) and got to work.

### The deck

![Image](resources/images/blog/6-1.png)

It's pretty self explanatory: have <auto-card>Near-Death Experience</auto-card> and either <auto-card>Mischievous Poltergeist</auto-card> or <auto-card>Wall of Blood</auto-card> in play during your opponent's end step, activate the creature's ability until you're down to 1, then win during your upkeep.

![Image](resources/images/blog/6-2.png)

Having 8 copies of the life-drain half of the combo is great, and you can get up to an effective 8 Near-Death Experiences with <auto-card>Lost Auramancers</auto-card>, optionally triggering them early using <auto-card>Heartless Act</auto-card>, which is a reasonable inclusion for most black decks anyway. In the initial build, I went with 4x of every piece except the Auramancers, which I dropped to 2, figuring they would add only minimal consistency.

While the combo is the exciting part of the deck, we already know that the fastest build of the deck would include 4x of every combo piece, so it's potentially the manabase where we stand to learn the most. I started with an equal number of white and black sources: on one hand, Near-Death Experience requires triple white and the Auramancers require double; on the other, we have twice as many black spells as white. Penny Dreadful offers a paltry selection of dual lands, but we've got the WB filter land, a tapped dual, the WB Karoo, and a tapped black source to mess around with.

### The code

Now we're not trying to write an actual AI, so it's a good thing we picked a simple combo: get NDE and a leeching creature into play and win on your next upkeep. That doesn't mean we don't have any decisions to make! Which land do we play, which spell or spells do we cast, and how do we pay for them? I went with a state machine that follows these steps:

* Determine all combinations of colors of mana we can produce, given the lands we have in play and up to one from hand
* If any of those combinations let us cast the winning piece(s) of the combo, do it
* Failing that, spend as much mana as possible on playing new combo pieces, playing a tapped land if it doesn't interfere with that plan

Finding all combinations of colors and land plays is just a matter of iterating, making sure to order untapped lands at the front of the output and tapped lands at the back:

<pre><code>enum Card : int {
    Plains = 0,
    Swamp = 1,
	FetidHeath = 2,
    TempleOfSilence = 3,
	OrzhovBasilica = 4,
    PelakkaCaverns = 5,
	...
}

public List<ManaPossibility> GetAllManaPossibilities() {
	List<ManaPossibility> currentPossibilities = new List<ManaPossibility>();
    AddManaPossibilities(currentPossibilities, Card.None);
	...
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
		...
		if (i < 3) { // untapped lands
			landsInPlay[i]++;
			AddManaPossibilities(output, land);
			landsInPlay[i]--;
		} else { // tapped lands
			output.AddRange(currentPossibilities.Select(p => new ManaPossibility(p, land)));
		}
    }
    return output.Count > 0 ? output : currentPossibilities;
}
public void AddManaPossibilities(List<ManaPossibility> manaPossibilities, Card land) {
    int baseWhite = Count(Card.Plains) + Count(Card.OrzhovBasilica);
    int baseBlack = Count(Card.Swamp) + Count(Card.PelakkaCaverns) + Count(Card.OrzhovBasilica);
    int flex = Count(Card.TempleOfSilence);
    if (baseWhite > 0 || baseBlack > 0 || flex > 0) {
        // only count Fetid Heaths if we can produce colored mana
        flex += Count(Card.FetidHeath);
    }
    if (flex == 0) {
        manaPossibilities.Add(new ManaPossibility(baseWhite, baseBlack, land));
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i <= flex; i++) {
            manaPossibilities.Add(new ManaPossibility(baseWhite + i, baseBlack + flex - i, land));
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

I then hardcoded 8 functions that check for the validity of playing all combinations of combo pieces from hand, all quick and dirty like. They're ordered to represent the logic of the state machine described above:

<pre><code>if (TurnPlanLeechAndHeartlessAct(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played a leech and Heartless Act.");
} else if (TurnPlanLeechAndNDE(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played a leech and Near-Death Experience.");
} else if (TurnPlanLeechAuramancersAndHeartlessAct(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played a leech, Lost Auramancers, and Heartless Act.");
} else if (TurnPlanAuramancersAndHeartlessAct(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played Lost Auramancers and Heartless Act.");
} else if (TurnPlanNDE(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played Near-Death Experience.");
} else if (TurnPlanAuramancers(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played Lost Auramancers.");
} else if (TurnPlanLeech(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played a leech.");
} else if (TurnPlanHeartlessAct(state, manaPossibilities)) {
    Log(1, "Played Heartless Act.");
} else if (manaPossibilities.Count > 0) {
    state.PlayLand(manaPossibilities[manaPossibilities.Count - 1].landPlayed);
}</code></pre>

Throw in some simplified mulligan and scrying logic, and we're done! Many simplifications of rules and logic were used; check the [full source code](https://gist.github.com/thquinn/ac4b94c896e91efc2943076f9c00615e) to witness the extent of my sins. Here are some:

* No non-combo spells are simulated
* No maximum hand size
* Paris mulligans instead of London mulligans
* No more than one mulligan
* Mulligan decision based only on land count
* Naive land scrying
* Naive bounceland decisions
* Fetid Heath's fixing power is underrepresented
* Lost Auramancers makes a new copy of NDE rather than searching one up
* And on and on...

Needless to say, the simulations don't play out exactly like they would with a top pro at the helm. We're looking to make back the difference in volume: in Monte Carlo, that's the name of the game.

### The results

I popped in my build: 4 NDE, 8 "leech" creatures, 2 Auramancers, 4 Heartless Act, 24 lands, and 18 blank pieces of paper. Let's look at a sample game:

<pre><code>Drew Fetid Heath.
Drew Near-Death Experience.

We're seeing the gamut of cases here, handled adequately. Let's run a million trials and see if things look quite so rosy:

<pre><code>1000000 trials complete in 12165 ms. Average win turn: 10.00.</code></pre>

Reality setting in here... even considering the redundancies, with no card draw to dig for pieces it's not surprising that it takes time to find everything. I think this could come down a little with better mulligans, land plays, and scrying, but our 10.00-turn build will make a great "control group" for experimentation.

### The scientific method

Now the fun part: let's formulate some hypotheses and run some experiments to test them out!

**HYPOTHESIS:** 2 copies of <auto-card>Lost Auramancers</auto-card> is the sweet spot.

<img src="resources/images/blog/6-4.png" style="width: 50%;" />

Now we're talking! Here's some *actionable data!* As expected, the fastest build of the deck involves 4 copies of both Auramancers and <auto-card>Heartless Act</auto-card>, but now we can see exactly how much speed we get from each copy. Remember that though reducing the count of combo pieces may slow down the deck directly, those extra slots can be used for cantrips like <auto-card>Dusk Legion Zealot</auto-card>, ways to protect the combo like <auto-card>Faith's Shield</auto-card>, disruption like <auto-card>Hymn to Tourach</auto-card> (ooh la la!)... those extra slots will not go to waste, so we need to make sure that each copy of a combo piece meaningfully speeds up our clock.

So we don't really get an objective answer to our hypothesis here, but we can see that adding an additional Auramancers from our spot in the 10.00 cell would get us to 9.49 turns, a half turn faster on average. Hard to pass that up. The next copy only speeds us up by about a third of a turn. We can also see that, as one might expect, each Auramancers does significantly more work speeding us up than each Heartless Act. If we're only interested in pure speed, we'd play 4 Auramancers before we add even the first Act. That, I must admit, does come as something of a surprise: is it really faster to wait out the Vanishing 3 than to hope to draw both cards in the sub-combo? Apparently so. If single-target removal isn't good in the meta, or if I'm sideboarding against a creature-light deck, I won't hesitate to shave on Heartless Act.

**HYPOTHESIS:** We can afford to ditch a couple <auto-card>Wall of Blood</auto-card>.

<pre><code>4 Wall of Blood: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.00. (base case)
3 Wall of Blood: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.30.
2 Wall of Blood: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.72.
1 Wall of Blood: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 11.41.
0 Wall of Blood: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 12.51.</code></pre>

Ehhh... not really. Although it *is* the worse of the two combo creatures, it's still a resilient blocker that buys us time to go off. Maybe we could go down to three; any fewer than that and we're leaving too much redundancy on the table.

**HYPOTHESIS:** The utility of Pelakka Predation isn't worth the tempo loss from Pelakka Caverns.

<pre><code>0 Pelakka Caverns, 7 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.97.
1 Pelakka Caverns, 6 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.99.
2 Pelakka Caverns, 5 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.00. (base case)
3 Pelakka Caverns, 4 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.02.
4 Pelakka Caverns, 3 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.04.</code></pre>

Wrong again! I guess it makes sense, since all we're usually looking to do is play a 3 drop and a 5 drop, that we have ample opportunity to sneak in a tapped land. Of course, this is forgetting all of the cheaper non-combo spells that our deck is going to be running, but if we only care about the timeliness of our combo, it seems like Pelakka Predation doesn't slow us down much.

**HYPOTHESIS:** <auto-card>Orzhov Basilica</auto-card> is probably just too greedy.

<pre><code>0 Orzhov Basilica, 8 Plains, 6 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.27.
2 Orzhov Basilica, 7 Plains, 5 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.00. (base case)
4 Orzhov Basilica, 6 Plains, 4 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.79.</code></pre>

Wrong yet again, and in a big way: Basilica actually accelerates the combo! Looks like the deck spends more time waiting around for lands than I thought. Unless we're worried about land destruction or getting run over in the early game, going up on Basilicas looks like an easy win.

**HYPOTHESIS:** We should have an equal number of white and black sources.

<pre><code>+7 white sources, -7 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.95
+6 white sources, -6 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.88
+5 white sources, -5 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.86
+4 white sources, -4 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.83
+3 white sources, -3 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.83
+2 white sources, -2 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.86
+1 white source, -1 black source: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 9.91
no changes: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.00 (base case)
-1 white source, +1 black source: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.13.
-2 white sources, +2 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.30.
-3 white sources, +3 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.53.
-4 white sources, +4 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.84.
-5 white sources, +5 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 11.24.
-6 white sources, +6 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 11.75.
-7 white sources, +7 black sources: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 12.41.</code></pre>

<img src="resources/images/blog/6-5.png" style="width: 66%;" />

Aaaaand... wrong. Just exchanging Plains for Swamps/Pelakka Cavernses changes the math quite a bit, which, hey. Makes sense. We're not so far from optimal here, and it looks like we can get there just by exchanging 3 Swamps for 3 Plains, though it's not exactly a gigantic win, only improving our clock by 0.17 turns. That's a nice lookin' graph, though.

**HYPOTHESIS:** The likely rotation of <auto-card>Fetid Heath</auto-card> in the next Penny Dreadful season is gonna hurt.

<pre><code>no changes: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.00 (base case)
-4 Fetid Heath, +2 Plains, +2 Swamp: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.33.</code></pre>

Fetid Heath has climbed to 0.73 tix as of this writing, which is a far cry from the 0.02 maximum for Penny Dreadful legality. An extra third of a turn isn't the end of the line, but let's face it: the deck wasn't stellar to begin with. Might be a good excuse to brew anew come February.

### Conclusion

<pre><code>no changes: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 10.00 (base case)
+2 Lost Auramancers
+4 Plains
-5 Swamp
-1 Pelakka Caverns
+2 Orzhov Basilica: 1000000 trials complete. Average win turn: 8.84.</code></pre>

So how useful is any of this, really? I don't know. I'm willing to bet that there are real decks in real formats that'd benefit from this approach. Even just goldfishing, and even with simplified rules and logic, you can get certain statistically significant results far beyond what would be feasible with human playtesting. At the very least, it seems a valid tool for sanity checking mana bases. If you're so able and inclined, give it a try with your pet combo! It might prove some of your assumptions false, as it did with nearly all of mine.

Check back here during the next Penny Dreadful season, and you could see a more in-depth exploration of <auto-card>Jeskai Ascendancy</auto-card> Combo using [MCTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)! Or you could see whatever other thing has grabbed my attention that month. Thanks for reading, and [go try Penny Dreadful](https://pennydreadfulmagic.com/)!
