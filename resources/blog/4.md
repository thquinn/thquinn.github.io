# Ludum Dare 46 Postmortem
##### April 28, 2020

Jeez, my last Ludum Dare was a year ago?! The time, it does fly. And I hadn't finished any games since, so I was extremely ready to participate in this one. And participate I did! After a 20 minute brainstorm — my fastest ever, by far — I had my idea: part [Rain World](http://rainworldgame.com/), part [Mirror's Edge](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/Mirrors_Edge/), and part [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi).

[Feed Me!](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/feed-me-3) is a 3D first-person platformer where you explore a procedurally generated ruin, looking for fruit to feed to a little creature that follows you around. I had never made a 3D environment of any kind before, let alone in 48 hours, so I knew it was going to be a tough one. It was! It's also the proudest I've been of a game jam result. I mentioned in [my last postmortem](blog.html?post=1) that the complexity of my games had been getting a little out of control, and I really reined it in this time. Instead of learning a bunch of rules, the game is all about coming to understand the behavior and needs of your extremely needy companion. That's not to say it's easy, though.

### The Visuals

I have basically never even created a 3D model before, let alone a whole 3D world with interlocking rooms and animated characters, so I wanted to keep it simple. Just the day before, I had seen some very cool screenshots of [Crocotile 3D](http://www.crocotile3d.com/) that made the creation of stylish levels look pretty damn easy. Those screenshots were probably what put the idea of working in 3D in my head to begin with. Under the duress of the ticking clock, I made the uncharacteristic move of buying it without even trying it, and... it's okay. $20 isn't bank breaking by any means, but it's a pretty crude and barebones piece of software.

I mean, just look at those lines! Yikes. The UI is quite poor, it features some questionable choices of hotkeys, and it outputs some gigantic, unoptimized OBJs. Had I the merest inkling of how to use Blender, I would have gone with its freeware rival [Sprytile](https://chemikhazi.itch.io/sprytile). Maybe I'll try to bone up before the next Ludum Dare. I knew I wanted to keep the draw distance low, so in combination with the standard depth fog effect, I created a tile map with black gradients to further sell the effect. This "darkness in all directions" style is very plain, but it *is* a style, and one I could pull off with my limited art skill and limited time.

On the opposite side of the software spectrum was my first time using [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/), a very slick — and free! — art program. There was no way I could learn to make proper 3D models during the compo, so I decided voxel art with squash-n-stretch "animation" was the way to go. I found it easier than pixel art, but still pretty hard. Even with a character already designed (I finally put my little mascot guy in a game!), it was a slow process.

While the models look very nice and [ambiently occluded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion) in MagicaVoxel, I didn't have time to replicate that effect in Unity. I had planned on baking occlusion maps for each of my models, but the OBJs from MagicaVoxel use palette-based UVs and I couldn't figure out how to rewrap them in Blender while retaining the existing skinning. The option to export with a propert texture and full UVs would have been nice, but it was my lack of skills that left the models looking so flat in-game. One commenter mentioned that it gave the illusion of billboarded sprites, which I guess is kinda cool... I think ambient occlusion would have been better, though.

### Procedural Generation

I came up with what must be a pretty common generation scheme that reminds me of the tile-laying rules of [Carcassonne](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne): each segment of the world is defined by what kind of edges it has. Does it have a wall to the north? Are there two doors across from each other? By creating a large enough set of tiles, and flipping and rotating them to fit, I could make sure that I always had the right tile to fit into a gap. Unlike in Carcassonne.

At the very beginning, I had grand plans of not just generating outwards, but vertically as well. I was going to have stairs that you could climb up and holes to drop down through... in the last day, it became clear that this just wasn't going to happen. Not only was it going to take a bunch more time implementing the system and designing a bunch more world tiles with verticality in mind, but the helpless creature following you is just too stupid and clumsy to coax up and down all over the place. Fortunately, I had designed the generation system with verticality in mind, but not necessarily requiring it. I was able to comment it all out in two minutes.

### Where I messed up... again

The most common criticism, besides some minor confusion about mechanics, has been that people aren't crazy about the way the player handles.

* "Floaty"
* "didn't seem as smooth as I'd expect"
* "I found myself falling off when i didn’t think I would"
* "could have been more fluid"

Exactly the same kind of stuff I heard about my last LD game. And to be honest, I didn't really learn much from MeltUp about how to make fluid, responsive platformer controls. I mostly learned not to have a convex bottom to the player's collider... but then I did the exact same thing again this time by using capsule colliders...

...causing both the player and the creature to slip off of edges, which basically never happens in any platformer. Playing against people's expectations for no reason like this is costing my games a lot of goodwill. I'm going to have to make a more concerted effort to figure out proper platformer collision and momentum. I'm pretty sure "momentum" is my problem, actually: I'm using way too physically accurate a model to determine player acceleration and friction. People want to be able to stop on a dime and turn with a tight radius in platformers. Having control is fun! I need to let go, at least a little, of the concept of momentum.

Another stupid and avoidable mistake I made was to keep writing code while completely exhausted on Friday night — complex procedural generation code, no less — which resulted in a stupid bug that I spent another 90 exhausted minutes finding and fixing. I would have been better off if I had gone to bed at any point of that whole debacle.

### The Music

I have a lot of difficulty writing long pieces of music with multiple sections that smoothly transition between each other. I really try to put enough music in my games to not drive people crazy when it loops over and over again, which has historically cost me a *lot* of dev time that I didn't have. This time, I instead wrote a little script that randomly picked from a few short pieces of music, each about 45 seconds and never picking the same one twice in a row. This was a ***huge, huge success.*** Not only did I get to write 4 minutes of much simpler music which took only 30 minutes, but it also increases the perceived variety of the music when the parts are continually rearranged. I'm doing this for *every jam* from now on. I'm only mad I didn't think of it sooner.

### The Theme

I'm not gonna write another goddamn dissertation on why the theme was bad, like I did last time. I mean, it wasn't *bad*, per se, just a little disappointing considering there were [a bunch more interesting ones](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/theme) that made it to the final round of voting. "Keep it alive" was one of only five I downvoted, and I upvoted the other ten! Ultimately, though, I was just happy that I didn't have to deal with "social distancing," "flat curves," or something along those lines. I'd call this one a win for the Ludum Dare voting public.

### To conclude

Super proud of this one, and I'm already taking steps towards a post-LD version. Very excited to see where I end up ranking. 1382 compo entries is a lot... would it be too much to hope for top 50 overall? I guess I'll find out soon!
