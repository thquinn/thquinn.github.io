# Ludum Dare 47 Postmortem
##### November 2, 2020

I had such high hopes for my last Ludum Dare game, even [predicting a top 50](blog.html?post=4), so let's see how we did... *[362nd place](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/feed-me-3)?!* Not gonna lie, I was disappointed. I have theories as to the reason, but really I was just itching for a shot at redemption. October couldn't come soon enough.

I spent the first four hours of Ludum Dare 47 fruitlessly brainstorming, and the next four asleep. 40 hours remained. It wasn't looking good.

### Rocket science

So yeah, brainstorming. There's this concept called [the wait calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel#Wait_calculation) that relates to interstellar travel. Put simply: if you wanted to travel to a distant star, should you leave now on a sluggish 21st century rocket that could take thousands of years to arrive, or wait and hope that faster rockets are developed? And how long should you wait? The more familiar [wait/walk dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait/walk_dilemma) asks a similar question: do you keep waiting for a late bus, with no idea of how late it might be, or do you just start walking?

Game jams have a similar thing going on. Sure, after five minutes of brainstorming, I had *an* idea. The theme, "stuck in a loop," reminded me of the classic freeware shmup [Warning Forever](http://www.hikware.com/Prod/index.html#wf) in which you fight the same enemy over and over as it evolves to exploit your tactics and weaknesses. I could do my own take on that, but what was I going to add? The perfect game jam idea will pop into your head — my head, anyway — with basically the entire game in tow, and this wasn't that.

It was tempting to start then, with a full 47 hours and 55 minutes of productive time left. I'm really glad I didn't: not only does a more complete idea save time on design, it's a total slog to work on an idea you're not excited about. While I *technically* would have had 48 hours to work on my shoot-'em-up, I'd be constantly stumbling over design questions, not to mention how much easier it is to procrastinate when next steps aren't clear. I didn't want to settle for the slow rocket.

9 hours in, just as I was about to throw in the towel and go back to playing [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/) — God, I really just wanted to play Hades — it finally came to me.

### Simplicity and balance

As I've mentioned in past postmortems, I have a hard time keeping things simple. I succeeded with my first Ludum Dare submission, but as I grew more confident in my game making abilities, I increasingly gave in to my worst tendencies. I thought I had tamped things down last time, and I had! The game's tutorial was just an image shown on screen for a few seconds: WASD, mouse, left click, right click. So why did people struggle so much with it? Well it was obtuse, almost intentionally so, thrusting you into a dismal environment with unclear motivations. And it was hard, so hard! Why do all of my games have to be so hard?

It's pretty dang hard to balance a jam game while you're making it. You don't have to learn how to play it because the idea came from your own head, and by the end of the jam you've spent an hour or more playing it just to make sure it's working. It's an easy way for my masochistic taste in games — bullet hell, roguelikes, [Zachtronics games](http://www.zachtronics.com/) — to turn into sadism. This time it was going to be different!

Ahhh, much better. Doesn't that look more inviting than a dark cave? This time, I managed to make my game so simple as to require *no tutorial at all*, and people were able to figure out how to play anyway. The sign of a good jam game, I think. I'm willing to bet a not-insignificant segment of Ludum Dare raters give a game 30 seconds to catch their attention before they're reaching for the ol' Alt-F4. An instantly understandable concept might keep them playing long enough to actually enjoy themselves. Plus, if your game doesn't need a tutorial, you don't need to spend time implementing one: the ultimate win-win.

### The look

Right from the jump, I had a particular look in mind; you might call it "cutesy pastoral." More specifically, I wanted the game to be set on a windblown plain with waves of grass and swaying trees. The latter was easy enough, but for the former I wanted to try a shader. I had never written a shader for a jam game before, and I don't have a ton of experience with them in general. Having previously seen this [excellent breakdown of an effect in Super Mario Galaxy 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rCRsOLiO7k), I felt I knew just enough to give it a shot.

![Grass](resources/images/blog/5-4.gif)

In hindsight, it's a little too subtle. If it weren't for the abrupt loop, you might not even notice that the above image is actually an animated GIF. Get your eyes reeeal close to your screen and try not to blink. See it now? Yeah, could have done better here. Still, in context, I think it conveys the atmosphere I was aiming for. I made the left texture for value (it doesn't even tile seamlessly, but somehow you can't really notice), the right one for variation in grass density, and I found the middle one online to use for displacement and highlights.

That covered "pastoral"; for the "cutesy" half, I followed a friend's suggestion and went with faux [tilt-shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photography) ala the recent [Switch remake of Link's Awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZROB4TnYH_I). This made *two* full-screen shader effects, which had me a little concerned on the performance front. Indeed, it doesn't run well on old-ass laptops with integrated graphics. Some room for improvement here.

There's one area where I failed and phoned it in: the appearance of the track. The version that ended up being final isn't far from the programmer-art version I put in for testing purposes. Probably one of those Stockholm-syndome-esque cases where you spend so much time staring at something ugly that you start thinking it's beautiful. Well I'm under no illusions about that, really, but I failed in the last hour or so to come up with something better:

![Ugly track](resources/images/blog/5-8.png)

This was the alternative I tried, but jeez, it just looked so flat when compared to the solid geometry and crisp shadows everywhere else, so I slapped some shadow gradients on the original attempt and called it good. So much for evoking the countryside...

### The sound

I used the piecemeal music approach I detailed in [my last postmortem](blog.html?post=4), and boy did it work a treat. In some past compos I've spent up to two hours writing a two-minute piece of music — time I can ill afford in the 48-hour compo — and this time I managed three minutes of music in twenty. I'll continue to use this technique until either it stops working or I become a better composer. The new thing I tried this time was positional audio: the listener's position is raycast from the cursor to the plane, so you can hear each train pass by as you move your mouse. Like the waving grass, I'm not sure anyone noticed it. Maybe it, too, added to the atmosphere? I'm not sure if it even makes sense, but it sounded cool in the moment, so I went with it. Give it a listen and see what you think.

### The puzzles

I hadn't made a puzzle game for a jam before, and I struggled a bit here. It wasn't quite as bad as when I decided it would be a good idea to make [a narrative game with branching paths](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-sacrifice) in 48 hours, but it was a similar situation. Any genre that requires "content," as opposed to getting it for free via procedural generation or emergent gameplay, should be approached with caution. I think I got super lucky that the levels have even a semblance of progression and proper difficulty. I only managed to design 11 levels. Oh, and a fun fact about the last level:

![Maps](resources/images/blog/5-5.png)

I wasn't able to beat it during the jam, and I haven't beaten it to this day! To make sure it was possible, I turned the simulation speed up to 100x and simulated random clicks until it beat itself. First time I've ever brute forced my own jam game.

### The code

Just a short note on this, since it won't interest everyone. Though I may not be a self-taught coder, I am a self-taught game dev, and I'm not super familiar with engineering conventions in games. In the process of game jams and prototyping, I've developed a pseudo-[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) division of logic where, for instance, I have a ["model" class](https://github.com/thquinn/Circleline/blob/master/Assets/Model/Level.cs) in charge of tracking and updating a level's state and a "view/controller" [Unity script](https://github.com/thquinn/Circleline/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/GameScript.cs) that's only in charge of deciding how to display it. And hey, it works. Further room for improvement here.

### The results

Now that's more like it! Given that there were (exactly!) 800 submissions to the compo, I'm very happy with 6th. It's a new Ludum Dare high score for me, and it came with some very nice comments from some very nice people. Isn't it a little strange how the overall ranking is higher than almost every sub-ranking? It kinda makes sense to me, actually. I feel similarly about Circleline: it's a more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts kind of a deal.

So concludes a second Ludum Dare in the grip of a global pandemic. Thanks for reading, and stay safe out there. Oh, and get out there and vote tomorrow, eh?
