# Ludum Dare 48 Postmortem
##### May 3, 2021

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is a twice-annual event where participants try to make as good a game as possible in just 48 hours. After a 6th place finish [last time](blog.html?post=5), I was trying not to put too much pressure on myself this time, and... good, because [Obelisk](https://thquinn.itch.io/obelisk) probably isn't top 10 material.

### The idea

The theme, "deeper and deeper," reminded me of some brainstorming I had done for the [7 Day Broughlike](https://itch.io/jam/broughlike) jam. I ended up not participating in that one, but I'd been meaning for a while to take a swing at this idea. It was going to be a simple dungeon crawler, the twist being the ability to see the next floor before descending. You could use that information to make decisions about how to tackle the current floor, and occasionally harness skills and traps to reach down and mess around a bit. It seemed a natural fit so, in a Ludum Dare first for me, I decided to just go with a previous idea.

### "Broughlike"

So what the hell is a Broughlike? It's one of these ultraniche, sub-sub-genres that are popular among indie devs, one inspired by the games of [Michael Brough](https://twitter.com/smestorp). The [7DBL page](https://itch.io/jam/broughlike) offers a thorough explanation, but it boils down to a boiling down of the dungeon crawler: small levels, small numbers, few turns taken. No using every key on the board, no managing an inventory bursting with potions and scrolls. A procedural puzzle game dressed up as a roguelike. And look, right there on [the man's wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brough_(game_designer)): "This style of game, perhaps best exemplified by *868-HACK*, has become widely known as the 'Broughlike.'"

I don't know about *widely known*, but I've played [868-HACK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274700/868HACK/). It's not my cup of tea! I haven't thought much about why, and this ain't a review, so I'll leave it at that. Despite not getting much joy from playing it, though, I did find it pretty inspiring. There's a lot to be said for paring down a sprawling genre like the roguelike, where aspects of gameplay [are sometimes so onerous as to be automated](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Autoexplore). Making every decision an important one â€” a noble goal! I wanted to try, and what better time than during a jam?

The homage is evident, I think.

### What worked: enemy "traits"

It felt necessary that the enemies have different abilities and behaviors; it's one of the few things that stop this game from feeling like [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) or, God forbid, *checkers*. Instead of having multiple enemy types, each with a unique ability (and requiring unique artwork), I created a system of enemy traits that encouraged mixing and matching. This allowed for fun and unintended combinations: fast-moving enemies that steal mana with additional attacks, or a double damage trait that enhances the burning light of Radiant enemies. Each trait was quick to implement, and the only art required was a sprite layer to be placed above or below the existing enemy.

### What didn't work: balancing a roguelike

Though Broughlikes use small numbers to make mental math easier on the player, that doesn't make them any easier to balance. I had to manage curves for enemy counts per floor, XP values and level thresholds, costs, cooldowns, and rarities of player skills, multipliers for enemy traits... there was basically no chance I was going to get it right without extensive playtesting. Which there's never really time for. Plus, the nature of a procedural game guarantees that players will encounter situations that you didn't. I'm not sure if that risk is worth it in a 48-hour jam! In the future, I may focus on reliable genres that let me guide a player through a more... *intentional* experience.

### What got squandered: that whole idea of showing the next floor

Agh, I had such plans! Dropping stalactites, baddies teleporting up to surprise you, tiles falling and totally changing the layout of the floor below... I didn't have time for any of it. The only thing I managed to squeeze in was the "Third Eye" trait that lets enemies on the next floor see where you are, meaning they're waiting to wallop you right when you descend. Even with the benefits of hindsight and additional brainstorming time, I still don't have a slam-dunk idea that would pay this whole thing off. Perhaps it's just unneeded complexity, an indulgence I allowed myself after cutting the level size to 7x7. (This could have come down to 6x6, no problem.) I may return to Obelisk one day, but until then, this twist remains unfulfilled.

### In conclusion...

Well hey, at least I tried a new genre. And like last time, I got away tutorial free! I learned some valuable lessons, and I also recorded my first-ever development timelapse, so I'll close out with that. Thanks for reading, and go [give Obelisk a shot right in your browser](https://thquinn.itch.io/obelisk).
