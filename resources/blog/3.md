With the pandemic keeping everyone I know away from each other, it seemed like as good a time as any to learn how to make online multiplayer games in Unity. I tried and failed to find a succinct video tutorial, and so went with [Photon](https://doc-api.photonengine.com/en/pun/v2/) which is straightforward enough to figure out with just their documentation. And they offer 20 concurrent users of free capacity! Thanks, Photon.

I learned how to play Go at the advent of the DeepMind era and now promote it to anyone who'll listen. Seriously, it's an incredible game. It's over 2,500 years old and hasn't been outdone in elegance by any game since. If you know me, you've probably had to nod politely through my Go-related ramblings. It seems like it could be a strong mechanical base for a free-for-all multiplayer game of politics and intrigue, so I whipped up a prototype and convinced some kind friends to test it with me.

In retrospect, six players was a lot. You can see above that by the midgame, some alliances had formed and the struggle for territory was well underway. I was making a hopeless play against Yourdang for the lower-left corner and clinging to Wilson for dear life in the center. Rez and Dyl were fighting anywhere they could, with Rez winning out handily, and Lau had a massive — perhaps overmassive — territory in the upper right. The v0.01 rules are that the sole credit for captures goes to the player who covers a group's last liberty, and this was creating mercenary moments throughout the game: players lunging across the board at the right moment to strike the decisive blow.

The Wilson-Tom alliance, while powerful by dint of representing back-to-back turns, revealed another interesting twist in the all-or-nothing capture-credit rule: the player later in the turn order reaps most of the rewards of an alliance. It didn't always behoove Wilson to spend his entire turn only to lock up a capture for me. Perhaps this might spawn a convention where the later player is expected to give up their turn to request the alliance? We may never know.

While Wilson and I fought bitter fights against Lau and Yourdang in the tiniest corners of the board, Rez and Dyl realized that if they just stopped slapping each other for one second, they had easy claim to the juiciest territory. When they teamed up, the winners and losers of the game were clear. The rules as written don't allow for allies to win together, but we could all see that the eventual breakup of the blue-yellow axis would be a drawn out and messy divorce. We didn't want to put ourselves through that, so we threw in the collective towel. (Rez took it in my book.)

I had a blast, despite the balance issues. Multiplayer Go presents some interesting design challenges. When you throw in formal alliances with shared liberties, I'm not sure it's a tractable problem... but you can be sure I'm gonna try and tract it. Keep an eye out for v0.02. In the meantime, here's a [<i class="fas fa-file"></i> rules writeup](https://github.com/thquinn/MultiGo/wiki/v0.01-Rules), here's the [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> source](https://github.com/thquinn/MultiGo), and here are the [<i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> downloads](https://github.com/thquinn/MultiGo/releases) (available for Windows and Mac) if you want to try this with your own friends. I hope they're patient.
