Here's something weird: my game **Tiles** can now be found on the touchscreen in the new Ford F-150 Lightning! I developed it for Ford last year, and now that the truck is out, I can finally show it off.

It comes preinstalled in every F-150 Lightning, and it's a port/sequel to [Quintacolor](https://thquinn.itch.io/quintacolor), which I made back in 2018. It's got an updated look and a new "relax" game mode inspired by casual mobile puzzlers. What a fun project this was!
