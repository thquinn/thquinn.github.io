# Making the Cut in Bouldering
##### June 30, 2023

I've been getting into bouldering, [SWE cliché](https://tamirshklaz.medium.com/why-do-so-many-engineers-rock-climb-2b8e44d880b) though it may be. I was initially suckered in by the IFSC's excellent [live coverage](https://www.youtube.com/@sportclimbing/streams) of their tournaments. Action, commentary, on-screen graphics, 3D scans of the wall... they really should use a stable sort for that leaderboard, though. Anyway: these bouldering tournaments have a qualifying round, a semifinals, and a finals. The semifinals consist of four boulders that look kinda like this:

20 semifinalists have 5 minutes to climb from the START of each boulder to the TOP. If they can't get all the way, the ZONE functions as a halfway mark — partial credit. Once everyone's had their try, they're ranked and the **top 6** move on to the finals. The most important criterion in the ranking is **number of tops**: if you got to the top of three boulders and I only got two, you're above me no matter what. Ties are broken by **number of zones**. Maybe we both topped three boulders but I reached the midpoint of the fourth and you didn't; that's 3T4Z for me, 3T3Z for you, putting me ahead in the ranking. From there, ties are broken by various ways of counting attempts. At the end of semifinals, the rankings might look like this:

Ah, but look at that! 5th, 6th, and 7th place all got two tops and four zones, meaning Selma Elhadj Mimoune lost out on a spot in the finals by one measly top-attempt. Feels bad, man. In a perfect world, there would be a clean break between 6th and 7th, at least in the number of zones if not the number of tops. On the other hand, [designing these competition boulders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n46bGqw5dhU) is a delicate balance. A small crew of routesetters has less than a week to design 26 of these things for each "World Cup." They must create noticeable separation among the world's best competitive climbers without favoring any height or style. If they mess up, it could ruin the whole thing.

So: just how hard should they aim for these boulders to be? I decided it was time for (what else?) Monte Carlo. 20 climbers, four boulders, many millions of simulations.

Well that sure looks interesting, huh? It turns out that if you're looking for a clean break after 6th place, there are better and worse places to aim on the 2D difficulty spectrum. If about half of competitors zone each boulder and a fifth of those top, you can reach a nearly **50% chance** of top/zone separation between finalists and non-finalists. If that seems too stingy for you, there's another nice region above that around (60%, 50%).

Another thing we can see is that the upper left quadrant of the graph is pretty treacherous. Sure, you can aim for that green patch at (30%, 80%), but if your boulders are just a little easier to zone than you thought? Suddenly you're very likely to give 6th and 7th the same top/zone score.

And what might that score be?

Here we see that "good separation" at (50%, 20%) likely has 6th with 1T2Z and 7th with 0T3Z — that's a low-scoring finalist. I mean, this sport is meant to be exciting, right? People want to see climbers succeeding, not just dashing themselves against the unyielding rocks.

So maybe it's better to aim for the upper... right... middle? 2/3 to 3/4 of climbers reaching the zone, and the same proportion of them reaching the top as well. According to my simulation, that would yield a 35-40% chance of separation at the finals cutoff: trading a bit of separation potential for a more watchable World Cup.

## Limitations

This is all according to *my simulation,* whatever good that's worth. These computed competitors are all alike, with no correlation between zone chance and top chance. That means I'm probably underestimating the separation probability, since having a range of skill levels among climbers makes it more likely that there will be a meaningful gap between the finalists and semifinalists. In fact, I did run some simulations with this factor included: the shape of the probability graph was very similar, but flatter, with higher chances overall. Routesetting seems to have less effect on separation when there's already strong separation among the athletes.

## Conclusion

I mean, this whole thing is a matter of taste. Maybe routesetters and competitors don't mind *that* much when they have to resort to the second tiebreaker and beyond to make the cut. If they do, though, they could consider reducing the percentage of zones, by quite a bit even. It's not uncommon to see a semifinals where 90% or more of possible zones are reached. The simulations indicate that that number could go down all the way to 50% and the chance of separation would be significantly higher, even if the percentage of tops also came up, to keep things more exciting.

And that's that! Thanks for reading. And hey, consider watching some competitive climbing! It's fun.
