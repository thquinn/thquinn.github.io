# The Best Friends Game: LIVE!

One of my very favorite games is the Best Friends Game — BFG for short. It's not a video game, it's not a board game, and it's not a card game. It's a... car game. A roadtrip game, like I Spy and the License Plate Game, and I am not ashamed. I stole it from the venerable [Comedy Bang! Bang! podcast](https://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/), where it was played under the name "What Am I Thinking?" with some [very enjoyable results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB-OVZmo7Do).

It's played like this: you and a friend each think of a random word, simultaneously reveal them, then secretly think of a new word that perfectly encapsulates both of the previous words. Perhaps the random words are **VARIETY** and **COLOR**... I would lean towards **RAINBOW** as the word in between the two. But your friend may disagree! Success hinges on your understanding of the other player's thought process. If you match, you win! If you don't match, you keep playing round after round until you do, slowly converging on a central concept.

I'd been forcing it on friends for about a year when the band OK Go [took a swing at commercializing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sP1DqyagXE) as "Say the Same Thing," an iOS app hamstrung by burdensome microtransactions. I mean, I like that treadmill dance as much as the next guy, but they really blew it with this one. It doesn't seem to exist anymore. Anyway. Since then, I'd always intended to try my hand at an implementation. I made a chatbot that facilitated online play, which was great until Google dropped XMPP support, and AIM dropped off the face of the Earth. So how do I get my BFG fix in 2019, and can I do it while both imposing my fringe game-design philosophy on it *and* making myself the center of attention?

I made a custom stream overlay and chatbot in Unity, enabling a live stream that a couple dozen of my friends were kind enough to play along with. Thanks to [TwitchLib](https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib), which was a little wonky but certainly got the job done. I'll be cleaning it up and sticking it on my Github soon enough; I wasn't able to find many good Twitch/Unity implementation examples, so maybe someone will find it useful. [Here's a recording of the stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrNiltXd1g) if you want to play along after the fact. And hey, why not [follow me on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thquinn) in case this kind of thing happens again? You can find me there about once a year — programming games, [speedrunning the obscure Nintendo DS puzzle game Meteos](https://www.speedrun.com/Meteos), and performing other acts of vanity.
