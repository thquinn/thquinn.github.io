[Dicey Dungeons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/) is a nice game! Since the advent of the roguelike deckbuilder, I'd been wondering if there's some design space away from the now-cliche deck of cards. Turns out: there is! It's dice. The game features 6 character classes, each with their own little twist, and one of them is the Robot, who comes with a neat little math problem. I'm not really a math guy, but hey. Let's give it a shot.

It's a [push-your-luck](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2661/push-your-luck) kinda deal: you roll dice one at a time, stopping whenever you want, until their combined value reaches some number. If you hit the target exactly, you get a bonus! If you overshoot the mark, your turn is over. So the question is: which target numbers are easiest to hit? Which are the hardest? And how should that affect your strategy?

Let's calculate some probabilities! We can start with the base case: if your target is 0, you're there before you even start.

If your target is 1, only one of the six results will do. If we do get that one, it results in the base case, otherwise we overshoot.

If your target is 2, a roll of 1 takes you to the p<sub>1</sub> case, a roll of 2 to the base case, and anything else is a bust.

...and so on. Eventually, because the dice only have six results, we reach a maximum of six previous terms, and the rest shop showing up:

Which we can generalize to this:

So what's so interesting about this? Well, it's not monotonic â€” it doesn't just keep going up and up. It has a kind of funky curve:

That's right: the easiest target to hit is 6, with a roughly 36% chance! 7 is way less likely; at ~25.4% it's harder even than 5 or 4. And here was a surprise to me: 11 is just a little better than 12. Huh. I would have bet money. <b>TL;DR:</b> if the Robot has the ability to massage the distance between the running total ("CPU") and the target, aim for 6, 5, and 11.

Here's another thing that had me scratching my head:

where k is the number of faces on the die and n is the target number. This means if that you were aiming for some arbitrarily high target with a d6, your chances of success would be exactly <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. This really surprised me at first. Not <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>? Upon extensive reflection, though, this makes perfect sense. The average roll on a d6 is 3.5, which has you stepping down the number line 3.5 units at a time, on average. What's the chance you hit a number exactly? <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3.5</sub>, or <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.

Let's round out with a fancy graph that illustrates this problem for dice with 6 or more faces:

and a little Mathematica formula for those inclined to toy around. Thanks for reading!

<pre><code>f[k_, n_] := f[k, n] = Piecewise[{{0, n < 0}, {1, n == 0}, {Sum[f[k,n-x]/k,{x,1,k}], n > 0}}]
f[6, 100]</code></pre>
