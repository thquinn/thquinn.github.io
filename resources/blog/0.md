# It's a blog!
##### June 4, 2019

Hello! I'm Tom, and this is a blog. My blog. I'll admit that I don't have a *ton* of ideas for it, but I expect one will come to me every few months or so. It's just that I discovered [this neat library](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) and had to figure out something to use it for. And that thing was to reinvent the wheel, as I do, and make my own little blog framework. With no features.

If you haven't checked out my various projects, I implore you to click the header and do so.

Thanks for stopping by!
